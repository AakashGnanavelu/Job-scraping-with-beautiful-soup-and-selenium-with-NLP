# Job-scraping-with-beautiful-soup-and-selenium-with-NLP

This project aims to match job seekers and job oppertunities together. The project uses natural language processing to tokenize the resume
and the job post. An algorithm will calulcate how many of the keywords in the resume are in the job post. The algorithm also has capabilities
to search for synonyms of the keyword within the resume. I have tested out different NLP libraries in order to find the best and most efficent
one possible. All the code is available in this repo.

This project has many chances to imporve. Currently, the project is very inefficent, and by using Object Oriented Programming, it is possible
to further enhance the efficency.

Do note that LinkedIn does not allow any bots or webscrapers to take information of their site, so discretion is adviced.
